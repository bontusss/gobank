I'm building this to learn how to build a basic fintech service and a complete, scalable microservice in golang.

- [@bontusss](https://www.github.com/bontusss)

## Roadmap

-: The API service will be powered by gin gonic.
I have used dbdiagram to design the database schema and sqlc to generate golang codes for database connections and crud operations. The db folder has all database files for the project. db/sqlc folder has autogenerated code from sqlc. db/query folder has queries for the three tables [accounts, entries and transfers]

## Features

- dockerized 
- Create account [todo]
- make transfers [todo]
- user auth [todo]

## Tech Stack

<!-- **Client:**  -->

**Server:** Golang, Postgres, Docker, sqlc
